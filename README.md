# bitmap-transformer
## Bitmap Transformation lab 04
This application creates a Bitmap object that contains three transformation methods: convertBW, flipImage, and halfSizeIt.

 ### lab04 Challenge
Build a bitmap (.bmp) transformer CLI. It will read a bitmap in from disk, run one or more color or raster transforms and then write it out to<br />
a new file. This project will require manipulating binary data. Your solution should be composed of small tested methods that solve specific<b4 />
problems. Your methods should be thoughtfully named and well documented. You should run ./gradlew run --args 'input output transform' to <br />
run your application. Your bitmap transformer modules should not use any third party libraries.<br />
